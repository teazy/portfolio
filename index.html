          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>One thing I can tell about myself. Is that I am a very stubborn male. When I see something I really have a drive towards, I will reach towards the goal I set myself to. Having a hard work ethic is one of my better features of myself. Another feature about me, is my sense of humor. I enjoy telling jokes and hearing them! It’s even better when my humor makes someone laugh or smile. 

Making someone’s day is the greatest feeling in my mindset. I always make jokes even in the most serious situations. Speaking of making someone’s day, I really enjoy helping people. Especially if the people I can help inspires them to help others too. One thing that really describes me, is that I’m never really that serious. I will literally laugh in a funeral like legit no lie, I almost did at Eddie’s funeral. That’s just a bit about me in a 150 words or more.
